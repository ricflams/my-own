## 📂 Folder Structure Strategy
* **`/own` (Current Context):** My personal knowledge base, journals, dotfiles, and scripts. Source of truth for my identity.
* **`/code`:** Neutral ground for code repositories. Each subfolder is an independent Git repo.
* **`/work`:** Employment-specific context, logs, and scratchpads.

## 🛠️ Preferred Stack
* **Editor:** VS Code
* **Shell:** PowerShell / WSL
* **AI Tools:** Claude, Gemini

## 📝 Rules for AI
1.  When asked to generate code, check `/code` first to see if a relevant project exists.
2.  When asked to log info, append to `/own/journal/[Year]/[Month].md`.
3.  Do not place personal secrets in `/work`.
